# Descrption

This is a project about a fake shop, where you have a basic structure of a typical shopping website.

When you open the shop, the first view is the login page, if you are already registered you can login but if you are not, you can create an account.

In case that you don't login, you can not continue going though the website.

Once you login, you'll see a view with a navigation bar that contains a logout button, a link to your profile and a link for the view that you already are, products.

In the products section you'll see a list of the products with a photo and its name. You can see 5 products per page and you can go to the next, last or first page. Also, you can see a search bar, you can search any product with minimun 3 letters.
